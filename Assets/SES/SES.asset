  - Heading: SES Client Code
    Text: This assembly contains the client code that we'll use to leverage the AWS
      SDK and talk to relevant resources (SES), the main class 'SESController' takes
      an instance of an 'IAmazonSimpleEmailService' in its constructor signature,
      which keeps the creation of our client code separate from the creation of its
      main dependency. This keeps our code loosely coupled and, most importantly,
      ensures it's testable.
